            <p>Born in Philadelphia, fine art landscape and nature photographer Peter Coskun specialises in showcasing the beauty and the fragility of desert ecosystems. His images present a stark contrast between the pristine beauty of wild places and the reality of threatened environments, and he uses his art to raise awareness for their protection.</p>
            <p>As a teenager, I loved riding BMX bikes in the desert behind my home. I had taken a photography class at school and used to take the school's film camera out with me on my bike rides so that I could practise. One afternoon, during a large BMX contest, I wandered up to a high ridge, and was stunned to see the desert looking unusually green, and it was a scene that I immediately wanted to capture. Over time, I acquired professional equipment and turned my lens towards the local wildlife. Bird and wildlife photography fascinated me, but I found my stride in landscape photography, which allows me to explore my surroundings and see things in the environment that I might otherwise overlook.</p>        
            <h3>What has been your hairiest moment out in the desert?</h3>
            <p>Once, while shooting wildflowers under the Superstition Mountains, I found myself caught in a sudden, intense thunderstorm. Without any rain gear and miles away from my car, I took shelter under a small mesquite tree – really not the safest place to be, but being the desert, there were very few options for cover. There were lightning strikes in every direction. The blinding flashes followed by incredibly loud cracks of thunder were making me uneasy while I hunkered down, hoping not to get struck. The rain eventually stopped, and I could see an opening on the horizon. Soaked and on edge, I decided it was safe enough to get back to finding my shot. I chose a group of blooming brittlebushes as the colours of the sunset lit up the sky. Just as the colours were at their peak, one last lightning bolt struck over the mountain. I have never left without a rain jacket in my pack since.</p>

            <h3>Regulating the climate </h3>
            <p>The vast ocean is divided into five “basins” – Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Southern.2 Collectively, it covers about 71% of our world and is instrumental in the processes that keep us alive.
                Firstly, whilst the rainforests may be referred to as “the lungs of the planet”, scientists say it’s actually the ocean that provides 50-80% of the oxygen3we breathe. Then, through a “conveyor belt”4 action, it helps regulate Earth’s climate by transporting heat away from the equator, towards the poles to cool.
                But the ocean also proves itself essential in the fight against climate change too. It absorbs 50 times more carbon dioxide5 than our atmosphere – or rather, it’s not the ocean itself… but what lives in it
                Many forms of aquatic life naturally absorb and hold carbon,6 which is taken down to the seabed – and kept there – when they die. From microscopic phytoplankton to gigantic whales, life of all shapes and sizes play a part in feeding these “carbon sinks” (areas that absorb more carbon dioxide than they release).And perhaps one of the most incredible forms is the humble seagrass.</p>
            <h3>What does a daily routine look like for you when out shooting?</h3>
            <p>On shooting days, I typically start prep the night before ­– formulating backup plans should my ideal shoot not work out, checking the weather multiple times and scouting locations via Google Earth to see what obstacles I might encounter. After that, I'll pack my camera gear. I usually arrive on location at least an hour before sunrise so I'll have enough time to scout for compositions. Once I choose my shot, I set up my gear and wait for the light to illuminate the landscape. The rest of the day involves scouting for sunset locations and capturing smaller details in more intimate photographs. Many of these hours are spent waiting for the right light and admiring the incredible scenery before me. Depending on cloud cover and moon phase, I may stay out after sunset to photograph the night sky, or in some cases, arrive on location in the middle of the night and photograph the stars prior to sunrise.</p>
